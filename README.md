# Metrics 
Help collect social media metrices using the following evaluations:
- no. of followers per social media platform
- net new followers per month
- likes / retweets / shares per post
- community growth
- website visitors
- email signups
- snetiments (including interview resposnses)

# Frequency
- Twitter: 3-5 per day; Focus on quantity -one post per hour is optimal (retweets inculded)
- Facebook: 5-10 per week; Focus on quality - aim for 2 posts per day to keep the audience interested
- Linkedin: 2-5 per week; Focus on formal, technical content - posts get more traction during the work week

# Preprints 
## Posting Preprints
- Choose from https://osf.io/preprints/africarxiv/discover and make sure to track the already posted preprints at (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d99iVq_BIhmb7VqV27jDS7L8CHSRhIyNsrmdTi0P-3U/edit#gid=0)
- Highlight the country, where it’s coming from / where the study is located
- c&p APA citation style from preprint entry 
- Add flag emoticon if feasible
- Add hashtags (keywords from manuscript)
- add #ResearchinAfrica #OpenAccess #preprint (if space allows)
- Add a screenshot from the manuscript (title page, figures, tables)
- If possible, tag at least one author on Twitter for the correspinding post 
- Example of a preprint post: 
> A #preprint from South Africa and the USA:
> Berger, L. R., & Hawks, J. (2020, January 30). Revisiting the age of the Florisbad hominin materia https://doi.org/10.31730/osf.io/eqs7d
> #Pleistocene #anatomy #homosapiens

### Hashtags
- 3-5 study specific hashtags that already exist on twitter 
- Not too research-specific but specific to the topic of study

### Images
- Screenshots from the accepted submission
- 1 overview image and 1 or 2 selected figures & tables
- Include the AfricArXiv logo on top of each screenshot
- Ensure that table or image description is also in the screenshot
- You can achieve this by adjusting the size of the browser window (zoom screen size from 100% to about 125% or 150%)
