We talked about synergies between PsySciAcc and AfricArxiv
- Identifying African contributors and collaborators 
- Challenge with financial constraints on the continent that affect research capacity
- Open Access increases research output - how can this be used for PsySciAcc?
- Small grants for data collection by African ECRs
- Call for PSA member labs
- Blog post to be published at https://info.africarxiv.org/news/

### Results
Blog post: https://info.africarxiv.org/join-the-psychological-science-accelerator/ 

The goals of AfricArXiv are to foster community among African researchers, facilitate collaborations between African and non-African researchers, and raise the profile of African research on the international stage. These goals align with the goals of a different organization, the Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA). This post describes how these goals align and argues that joining the Psychological Science Accelerator will benefit members of the AfricArXiv research community through increased collaboration and resource access.

### Next steps
- design a survey (Google Form) to collect contacts of African psychology scientists
- preprint submission guidelines
